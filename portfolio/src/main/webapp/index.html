                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <p>
                My name is Alex Albert and I am a sophomore currently pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Economics at the University of Washington in Seattle.
                </p>
                <h3>What am I currently doing?</h3>
                <p>
                Currently, I am working in the Sensors, Energy, and Automation (SEAL) lab at UW as a Software Developer on the ECoS project team. We are creating an application that assists researchers in their writing process. <br><br>Additionally, I am involved in a few other organizations around campus like Husky Robotics and the Science and Business Organization (SEBA). Recently, I was selected to serve as the VP of Professional Development for the Lavin Entrepreneurship program where I will work to create a comprehensive internship and career process for Lavin students.
                </p>
                <h3>What am I passionate about?</h3>
                <p>
                I love to make stuff. Whether it is building robotic rovers or sleek iOS apps, I yearn for the challenge of creating solutions to problems with technology. I also have a love for business -- you can often catch me perusing the (web) pages of the WSJ or catching up with one of the way too many business newsletters I am subscribed to.<br><br>
                In my free time, I love to lift weights and play sports.  Recently, I have been getting into meditation and philosophy, specifically stoicism. If youâ€™re into that, let me know! I would love to chat about my boy Marcus Aurelius sometime.
